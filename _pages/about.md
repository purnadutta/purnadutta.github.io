Hi, I am a first-year PhD student at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) with the [theoretical computer science group](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hung Le](https://hunglvosu.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrew McGregor](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/).

I finished BS and MS in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Berhampur](https://www.iiserbpr.ac.in/). I pursued my MS thesis project in theoretical computer science under the guidance of [Prof. Saket Saurabh](https://sites.google.com/view/sakethome) at [The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai](https://www.imsc.res.in/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
